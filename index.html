    <title>Picture Element with Webp Format</title>
</head>

    <!-- regular image tag with a webp image format-->
    <img src="img/autumn-leaves-in-wind-thumb.webp" alt="leaves blowing in the wind" />

    <!-- creating a fallback resource with webp 
        - not all browsers work well with webp format, so it's important to have fallback image type that works in all browsers suchy as jpgs, png, etc...
    -->
    <picture>
        <source srcset="img/autumn-leaves-in-wind-md.webp" media="(min-width: 981px)"" type="image/webp"/>
        <source srcset="img/autumn-leaves-in-wind-thumb.webp" type="image/webp"/>
        <!-- fallback image if the browser does not support webp-->
        <img src="img/autumn-leaves-in-wind.jpg" alt="autumn leaves" />
    </picture>

    <!-- 
        - The use of the picture element can be used as fallback image, but also as to swap out images at different screen sizes
        - to use webp as your default image we need to add an type attribute, without the type attribute the picture element will default to the jpg image. 
        
        so differnt type attributes would be:
        - image/webp
        - image/jpg
        -image/png...
        to make sure the browser is using our webp image we will need to add type="image/webp"

        * Remember, if you are swapping images for different screens the media queries the largest screen size needs to come first.
